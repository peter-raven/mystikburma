# The Burma Mystery

This is a source code archive of the danish text adventure "Mystik i Burma" (The Burma Mystery), produced by Peter Ravnholt 1990. The programming tools used were [Borland Turbo Pascal 5.5](http://progopedia.com/version/turbo-pascal-5.5/). This repository is kept for historic and nostalgic reasons ;-)
